            <div class="content" style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black; display: none;">
              <p><strong>We always say the same thing: wear whatever you want!</strong><br>

                  One of the great things about Rocky Horror is that everyone is welcome. People of all ages, ethnicities, walks-of-life and genders can come join the fun.
                  With such a diverse group, we're bound to see people wearing an array of astounding ensembles.
                  Come dressed up to let your freak flag fly, or dressed down in your favorite pair o' jeans.
                  Wear whatever you want; this party is for everybody.<br><br>
                  
                  <strong> Don't Know what to Wear? Here is some ideas</strong><br>
                  Come dressed as Frank, Columbia, Riff Raff or your favorite Rocky Horror character. We love it when people dress up in Rocky garb.
                  Put together a costume and who knows, we may even pull you on stage to show it off!<br>
                  
                  Your costume doesn't have to be from Rocky Horror - you can wear whatever costume you like.
                  Come dressed as your favorite character from a movie, TV show, anime, video game or anything else.
                  Get creative and have fun with it!<br>
                  
                  Well, do make sure it doesn't stink<br><br>
                  
                  <strong>Got a personal style of dressing?</strong><br>
                  Goth, Renaissance, zombie, whatever? Then dress that way to Rocky Horror.
                  You can wear pretty much anything you want, but you do need to wear something.</p>

                   <br>
                   <div style="color:#FFFFFF;" size="4px">The building that the Albany Theatre occupies was built in the 1920s,
                       originally as a meeting hall and then a dance hall with live music. <br> In 1935, the building was
                       converted to the new home of the Albany Theatre, which had occupied a small one-story wooden
                       building down the block since around 1914. <br> Structurally it stayed much the same over the years,
                       until the conversion of the balcony into the second auditorium in 1979. <br> More recent
                       improvements have both helped to regain some of the classical charm of the Albany <br> as well as to
                       ensure that everyone has a state of the art movie-going experience. <br> Located in the heart of
                       Albany, and acting as a centerpiece for the downtown area, <br> the Albany is in easy walking
                       distance of a wide variety of eating establishments, from a whole host of different culinary
                       traditions.<p></p></div>

              <p>From 1976 until 2001, it was as a movie theater known for a revival house presentation of films. <br> In 2013, The Berkeley Music Group was formed as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to renovate and operate the UC Theater as live music venue. It reopened its doors on April 7, 2016.<br><br>Rocky Horror was a staple at the UC for many years. It played every weekend for more than 2 decades.<br>

                Live cast Indecent Exposure performed Rocky Horror at the UC until 1995, before Barely Legal took over. <br>
                
                The "last" show was incredible, So many people packed in to see Rocky Horror one final time. Nobody thought it would ever happen again. <br>
                
                The UC was closed for many years. Then Converted into a live music Venue Still, the awesome history of Rocky Horror was so important.
